Start walkin' me through your basement apartment
Came without an upstairs key
Though you claim got a plan to go
The way you're holding me, i don't feel you moving
But you got to follow your feelings
You should know i don't want to leave just to go
I'm not trying to be hard to reach
But i've put away my only suitcase

And i said, "hey, so you play too rough"
But i wimped out and i waited
To say, "so, you play too rough"

So you sing it the way you want to hear it sung
You grab the telephone a minute before it's rung
And you call out into space saying
Do you ever want to run?
Well, i want to run and i want you to come
Just as you first came to me
Wearing only perfume and a coat
And too, too much to drink

"hey, so you play too rough"
But i wimped out and i waited
To say, "so, you play too rough"

Now hope well, it's got me by the throat
And all your bicycles are dreaming of their brakes
But my dreams have all been fake, so fake
So

"hey, so you play too rough"
But i wimped and i waited
To say "so, you play too rough"
I wimped out and i waited
To say so

I want to run and i want you to come
Just as you first came to me
Wearing only perfume and a coat
And too, too much to drink
